### Ahoy there, I’m 0xp1rate ⚓️

- 👋 Hi, I’m @0xp1rate — a backend developer sailing the JavaScript seas  
- 👀 I’m interested in scalable systems, APIs, databases, and all things backend  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about microservices, Docker, and diving deeper into Node.js performance  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on backend-heavy projects, open source tools, or anything cool and challenging  
- 📫 How to reach me: [@0xp1rate on Telegram](https://t.me/0xp1rate) or drop me an issue 😉  
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I probably wrote this README while drinking black coffee at 2AM
